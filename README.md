# ðŸŒ³ Tree Species Classification using Hyperspectral Imagery and Deep Learning

## Overview
This project uses synthetic hyperspectral data to classify different tree species using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to simulate tree species mapping using remote sensing.

## Features
- Synthetic hyperspectral reflectance data with 100 bands
- Five synthetic tree species: Mahogany, Teak, Pine, Ebony, Oak
- Deep learning model using 1D CNN for classification
- Training accuracy visualization and performance reporting

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
